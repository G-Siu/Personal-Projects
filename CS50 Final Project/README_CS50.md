        Description: I chose to focus on a D&D dice roller that takes into 
        account of a character's modifiers. The dice roll can be made as an 
        advantage, disadvantage, or straight roll. The character can be
        created and saved, and can also retrieve from a previously created 
        character. Character creation includes basic classes and races. 
        Race stats are added to the character's ability scores during 
        character creation.
