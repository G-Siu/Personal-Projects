## <u>**Summaries**</u>

### Session 1

<div style="text-align: justify">
In the city of Mythrandir, on the continent of Terra, a
team are being assembled by Akra, a teifling fighter and leader of the Slayer's
Take (a group that procures rare things for profit). 
Jessi, posing as a human bard, is looking for adventure and inspiration 
in her songwriting.

Together with <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>, a human fighter, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>, a teifing rogue, and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> a
half-elf rogue, they are tasked by Akra to retrieve basilisk fangs from
Storm Wreck Isle and collect information from a sorceress called Inara.  
After embarking on a boat with Joshua, the party is attacked by
Sahuagine. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> manages to kill them, while Jessi sings encouragement at the
back.

The party arrives at Storm Wreck Isle and travel to the
town of Dragons Rest. 2 groups of zombies were awaiting them in the woods.
<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and Jessi engage the zombies, whilst <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> wander
into the trees. The fight was short, Jessi managing to enchant one zombie to
flail around in the other direction drawing the others' attention.
However, as Jessi was concentrating on the spell, her disguise slipped,
revealing her half-elven lineage, where <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> was able to perceive but kept
to herself.

The party eventually make it to town, and are on edge. There they discover a
temple that worships the dragon, Runara, and meet Inara within. Inara
gives the party information as to the basilisks' whereabouts, and
also tasks them to find out the cause of the island's zombie infestation.

Afterward, the party head to a pub to settle in for the night for much
needed rest. Jessi performs, and the party gets to know each other a
little.
</div>

#### Song

<div style="text-align: justify">

    In the land of Mythrandir, a grand adventure begins, a mission from the Slayers
    Take, one they're determined to win.
    <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> the warrior, fierce as fire within.
    <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>, the tricky tiefling rogue, quick and sly.
    <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>, the half-elf rogue, secrets in her eye.
    
    Joined by Jessi, the bard with a melody so sweet,
    Together they set sail to a land so neat.
    Across the sea to Storm Wreck Isle they steer,
    Their hearts filled with hope, dispelling all fear.
    
    Oh, they're the Cross Swords, a band so brave,
    Facing danger head-on, their spirits never wane.
    Unyielding in their quest, they'll battle all foes,
    And in the end, they'll be hailed as heroes.
    
    Upon their voyage, the sea churns and roars,
    As they battle the Sahuaugine, those sea-dwelling horrors.
    With swords and spells, they fight side by side,
    United in purpose, their courage can't hide.
    
    Arriving at Dragons Rest, an ancient land of lore,
    Skeletons and zombies rise, an undead galore.
    But the Cross Swords stand strong, their will unshakeable,
    With their blades gleaming bright, they remain unstoppable.
    
    With hearts ablaze, they descend into the depths,
    Facing basilisks, the guardians they must best.
    Through perilous darkness, they navigate,
    Their unity and strength the darkness can't abate.
    
    Oh, they're the Cross Swords, a band so brave,
    Facing danger head-on, their spirits never wane.
    Unyielding in their quest, they'll battle all foes,
    And in the end, they'll be hailed as heroes.
    
    Emerging triumphant from the deepest abyss,
    The Cross Swords are hailed, the tale of their prowess.
    Heroes of Dragon Rest, their fame spreads wide,
    The saviors of darkness, with hearts unified.
    
    With heads held high, their victory they claim,
    Forever remembered, immortalized in name.
    <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>, and Jessi, a fellowship true,
    The Cross Swords, a symbol of courage anew.
    
    Oh, they're the Cross Swords, a band so brave,
    Facing danger head-on, their spirits never wane.
    Unyielding in their quest, they'll battle all foes,
    And in the end, they'll be hailed as heroes.
    
    Dragons Rest sings of their valor and might,
    The Cross Swords forever shining in the light.
    Their journey may end, but their legacy remains,
    A testament to friendship, overcoming all pains.

</div>

### Session 2

<div style="text-align: justify">
The party set off from The Dragon's Rest towards the observatory to investigate
the source of the undead and to find the missing sorcerer, Jensen. Whilst
moving through the woods, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> hears the sound of Zombies approaching. 
Three Zombies attack the party who choose to stay and fight, managing 
to defeat them. A hoard then arrives on the horizon but the party is 
saved by Runara, the Bronze Dragon who resides on Stormwreck Isle. 
Runara thanks the party for attempting to restore the natural order and 
protects them on their way to the observatory.

Once there, the party are set upon by several skeletons. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> take
these out by using their rogue stealth and acrobatics. The party then make
their way up the observatory tower and come across Jensen's quarters where they
find a broken mirror with Elvish inscriptions that <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> is able to decipher.

On the top floor of the observatory, the party encounter three skeletons, a now
dead and shackled Zombie Jensen, and a mysterious hooded figure in black robes
chanting a spell in Elvish, Infernal and (what Inara later identifies as) Deep
Speech. The figure hears the party and vanishes, leaving behind a pulsating,
glowing purple orb.

The party make quick work of the skeletons and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>
investigate the orb. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>, having missed all her previous attacks against the
skeletons, fires the killing blow to take out Jensen. Both <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> work
together to destroy the orb and the spell over the Isle is broken. The party
retires to Jensen's old quarters in the observatory tower and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> discovers
his diary in a hidden drawer.
</div>

#### Song

<div>

    (Verse 1)
    In a land full of darkness, where shadows do roam,
    There's a hero, they say, but I don't feel at home.
    I've fought many battles, with creatures of the night,
    But when it comes to skeletons, I just can't get it right.
    
    (Pre-Chorus)
    My sword swings wide, but it always goes astray,
    Those bony foes, they taunt me with decay.
    But when the horde of zombies come crawling through,
    I rise up with courage, knowing just what to do.
    
    (Chorus)
    I'm rubbish at killing skeletons, that's for sure,
    But I'm a master when it comes to zombies, I endure.
    With every swing and every strike, I'll face the undead,
    And I'll emerge victorious, that's where my strength is spread.
    
    (Verse 2)
    Those skeleton warriors, they dance with such grace,
    Dodging my attacks, always one step ahead of my pace.
    Their bones rattle and clatter, mocking my skill,
    But I'll keep on fighting, determined to fulfill.
    
    (Pre-Chorus)
    My aim may be off, my arrows miss their marks,
    But when the zombie horde surrounds me in the dark,
    I'll unleash my might, with an unyielding zeal,
    Their bodies will crumble, my prowess will reveal.
    
    (Chorus)
    I'm rubbish at killing skeletons, that's for sure,
    But I'm a master when it comes to zombies, I endure.
    With every swing and every strike, I'll face the undead,
    And I'll emerge victorious, that's where my strength is spread.
    
    (Bridge)
    The skeletons may sneer and laugh in their decay,
    But I'll prove them wrong, I'll find a better way.
    I'll train and grow stronger, honing my attack,
    Until the day I conquer, and their bones shall crack.
    
    (Chorus)
    I'm rubbish at killing skeletons, that's for sure,
    But I'm a master when it comes to zombies, I endure.
    With every swing and every strike, I'll face the undead,
    And I'll emerge victorious, that's where my strength is spread.

</div>

### Session 3

<div style="text-align: justify">
The party stay the night in Jensen's quarters in the observatory. They eat 
food and read the pages of Jensen's diary, revealing a member
of the council of Mythrandir has been visiting the island. 

In the morning, they ask Inara about the potions which she identifies to
be the Good Hope, Haste and Sanctuary potions. When asked about the
council member, she says she has an idea but doesn't reveal anything until
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> presses her for more information later on. She then reveals to
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> that she is suspicious of Vespera Shadowmire, her old mentor, who
she knows has been leaving on various research missions. She vows to
confront her on her return to Mythrandir.

The party enter the caves under the observatory and battle two
basilisks, working together using the shards of Jensen's mirror to defeat
them with ease. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> deal the final blows.
On exiting the caves, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s true identity is revealed: she is in fact a
half-elf, not a human and is 92 years old. Whilst <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> are
forgiving of <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> keeps her distance. The
party returns to the celebrating town of Dragon's Rest and are given free
drinks by the bartender, Greg, who asks them what they call themselves. At the
moment: The Cross Swords.
</div>

### Session 4

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Cross Swords are awoken by the sound of bells and witnesses the town of 
Dragon's Rest reburying their dead and mourning the loss of Jensen. The 
party waits for Inara in the library and return as a group to Mythrandir 
where they receive their bounty. Inara gives them a map of the city and 
says she will be back in touch. 

The party explore the city. They first enter The Crimson Sash clothing
store and meet an elderly gnome called Lilli Nim who repairs their tattered
clothes and designs their outfits with the Cross Swords symbol. The party then
split up to explore further.

<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>, with the goal to steal from the rich, tries to enter the Inner
Sanctum through the main gate, but it is guarded. Instead, she enters the
Temple of Bahamut, though decides that this is not the place
to steal and joins <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> in the Magic Shop, Jinx and Trinkets.

<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>, with the goal to improve her magic abilities, meets Kribi Mirlon, the
Magic Shop owner, who creates a perception potion for her. Both go to join
<span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> at the weapons shop: Tintagel Weapon Shop. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> meet
Merlin and his apprentice Arthur and receive new weapons and upgrades to
their armour. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> also receives an upgrade when she arrives. The party
then go to The Green Dragon pub where <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> performs for the crowd. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>
notices the symbol of The Swallow Thieves Guild and enters the secret
underground lair where she encounters an old friend of her father, the
leader of The Swallows, a half-orc named Baku. Armed with new illicit
trinkets, she returns to the group and a very suspicious <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>. T

The party rest for the night and return to The Slayer's Take where there is
a notice from the local farmer asking for help to kill an Ankheg in
exchange for 10 Gold and a horse and cart. Akra approaches <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and
reveals that a high level political client has offered a large amount of money
for the theft of the silver dragon egg in the study of Soros Davino, the leader
of the Myrandir Council.
</div>

### Session 5

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Cross Swords organised their outfits with Lilli Nim and returned to The 
Slayer's Take where Akra asked them for a rundown of their plan to enter 
the mansion. Inara called via the earring and said she was going to 
confront Vespera Shadowmire at the party and that she had a +1 ticket. 
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> took the ticket and organised to attend with Inara. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> 
decided to take the 2 tickets provided by Akra's client and pretend to be 
nobles from Klegas. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> met with her rival, Adran Amastacia, the lead 
singer of The Fleetwood Trio, and bargained her way into joining the band 
who had been booked as entertainment.

On arriving at the mansion, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> bumped into Kribi who revealed he was a
member of the council and the three of them had many drinks. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> was
introduced to Soros Davino (the leader of the council) and Lyslyl Strongsong (a
paladin from the Temple of Bahamut and member of the council). Everyone was
gathered in the dining room where Soros gave a speech about the nations coming
together in peace. During the meal, the party met Vespera Shadowmire who was
wearing a necklace that <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> recognised immediately. She remarked to <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> "
Is that the name you are going by nowadays?" She then told <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> that she
has some upcoming business near Klegas but was unsure if she would make The
Festival of the Hunt.

After dinner she excused herself and left quickly, followed swiftly by
Inara. Whilst the party scouted the mansion, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> hears the word "Ren-"
before silence. She rushed to the main door and asked the guards what had
happened. They were unresponsive and clearly under a spell.
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> called for <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> who was able to break the spell and the guards revealed
that Vespera and Inara had argued before Vespera had grabbed Inara saying "I
need another sorcerer now anyway" and both had disappeared.

Whilst <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> went to break the news of Inara's kidnap to the council, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>
managed to scale the building and land on the upper balconies revealing two
small bedrooms and a master bedroom. The doors were sealed with magic and
she couldn't get in. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> overheard Soros saying that the room was secure as
the guards had the keys and swiped a set of keys from an unsuspecting guard
which she handed to <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>. On the second floor, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> managed to
trick a guard into following them into Inara's guest room where they locked
him in. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> then distracted the final guard by trying to flirt with him
whilst <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> snuck up onto the top floor. There she encountered a sleeping
Hellhound and struggled to put the keys in the lock. This woke the
hellhound. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> managed to get through the door and over to the balcony
to open the window for <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> as the Hellhound attacked. She sent a signal to
the team for help. Hearing this <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> joined <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> on the second floor and
charmed the final guard who let them past. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> was able to talk to the
Hellhound using Infernal and was able to encourage it out onto the balcony. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>
picked up a lamp from outside the room and the party was able to use this to
solve the mirror riddle.

Once inside the study they came across a Gargoyle who asked a riddle. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>
was able to remember the speech Soros had given at dinner and gave the
answer: Footsteps. The Gargoyle released the Silver Dragon Egg and
<span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> managed to carry it outside. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> made graceful landings
when jumping off the balcony, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> did not. The egg made it safely. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>
returned to the band. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> retrieved Inara's carriage and took <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>
back to The Slayer's Take where Akra stored the egg in a secret room under the
floorboards. The Fleetwood Trio then burst into The Slayer's Take to reveal
that <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s charm had worn off the guard and that she had been arrested.
</div>

### Session 6

<div style="text-align: justify">
On finding out <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> had been arrested, Akra told the party to get rid of
Inara's carriage and find somewhere to hide till the exchange for the dragon
egg had been made. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> got rid of the carriage outside the city and was able to
sneak back in to meet <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> at the local tavern. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> took the pair
into the Swallow's Den where they met <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>'s uncle Baku who let them rest the
night and sent his Swallows out to find out where <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> was being kept. He also
gave <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> a cloak of Elvenkind as a gift. Baku recognised <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s last name, 
Strongbrooke, and revealed that he knows her father well and is currently 
doing business with her brother. The party make a plan and one of Baku's 
Swallows, a gnome named Baldur, dimension doored them into a cupboard in 
the council.

During this time, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> was making music in her cell with a halfling named
Bolger who was in for not paying his taxes. She sent a message to the party
saying that she had been arrested and gave a rough location of the cell she was
in. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> attempted to draw the guards away from the servant quarter doors by
causing a distraction, but it didn't work. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> put on a janitor's outfit and
convinced the guard that she was finishing up the back shift. The guard
followed <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> into the servant quarters whilst <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> stayed hidden in the main
hall and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> kept watch from the cupboard. Inside the servant quarters, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>
watched two guards exit the staircase guarded by a gargoyle and saw two other
guards replace them using the password "sandstone". <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> then knocked out the
guard watching her and used the password to sneak downstairs.

At this point <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> snuck into the room and was able to send a message to <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>
to get the password. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> made their way through the underground
jail and passed a cell which had a gnome inside called Nom who asked to be
released. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> agreed to release him if he would help save <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>. Nom agreed.
<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s cell was guarded by the two guards from the changeover and a
hellhound. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> pushed Nom forward who struck the hellhound with blue
lighting magic and it chased him back towards the exit. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>
attacked the guards with the aid of <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> who managed to steal keys off the
distracted guards. Once free, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> offered freedom to Bolger who refused.

Reunited, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> made their way back to the exit and came
across Nom who was laughing hysterically and ripping apart the hellhound
with his hands. They all retreated back up to the servant's quarters.
Meanwhile, from her vantage point <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> watched as Soros entered the council
main hall with an older woman dressed in green robes laced with bronze. She had
a tiara-like headpiece embedded with emeralds and made of bronze with two
pieces that went up like horns. She turned to the cupboard asked <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> to come
out. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> informs Baku through the dimension door that they may be
compromised, and he closes the portal.

<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> exits and discovers the woman is Runara, the bronze dragon from
Stormwreck Isle, in human form. Nom peaks out the door of the servant
quarters, sees Soros and Runara and disappears immediately. Runara calls
the party out and they all reunite. She brings news that a hoard of undead
have been seen around the Metal Mines, south from the city of Klegas. She
enlists the party's aid and Soros agrees to this saying that if they solve
this they will be absolved of their crimes. He also asks for the return of
the silver dragon egg. The party, now free and with a mission for the
council and Runara, return to The Slayer's Take where Akra gives them their
earnings from the dragon egg heist and a map of the continent.

The party undertake a mission from The Hunt Board in The Slayer's Take and
help farmer Bran Brightwood kill an Ankheg that has been terrorising his
sheep. In exchange for their help he gives them 10 gold and the use of a
horse and cart. The party choose Beauty, a black gypsy cob with a speck of
white on her forehead who seems calm and friendly. As part of the deal they
have to take her son, a pony yet to be named. The party look forward to
pimping their cart as their journey continues.

### Session 7

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Cross Swords prepares to set out for Klegas. All four head to Jinx & 
Trinkets Magic Shop where they encounter Kribi who is aware of the mission 
set by Runara and Soros. He gives <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> an everburning torch and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> a 
fireball scroll. He agrees to look out for any protective armour and if he 
finds some he will deliver it on to Klegas. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> then head to 
the Raven's Tower Library where they encounter Corrin, an elderly halfing 
and friend of Inara. Hearing that they are en route to rescue Inara, he 
gives them a book of necromancy and the undead. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> buys a book on 
monsters of the plains and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> borrows a book about the Elven families 
in the Kingdom of Elgarest. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> also borrows a book on Deep Speech in an 
attempt to learn it and decipher the spellbook which Corrin reveals to be 
Vespera Shadowmire's spellbook. 

<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> head to Tintagel Weapon Shop and ask Merlin for some upgrades.
He reinforces <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s scimitar, gives <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> 30 lighting darts and banes
<span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>'s dagger against the undead. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> arrive and have their daggers
baned against the undead too. Before leaving, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> finds Baku and sells him 5
tomes that she stole from Corrin's library.

The party leave Mythrandir and set off on the long journey to Klegas.
During the journey, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> reads the Deep Speech book and gains some
insight into the language. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> read the book of the undead and
become very familiar with the creatures in it. They also read a couple of
pages on the monsters of the plains. The first night passes with no issue.
On the second night, the party discover that their things have
been rummaged through. Nothing has been taken, but items have been moved.

On the third day, the party are attacked by a group of goblins on wargs.
The party put up a good fight with <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> managing to take some out,
scaring off the remaining rider and warg. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> gets knocked unconscious but
is revived by <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> then speaks to the remaining warg and encourages
it to flee. The party continue on and encounter no more monsters. On the
fifth night, they hear elves singing in the woods. They are mourning the
20-year anniversary of the death of King Eladithas who has been succeeded by
his son King Sylmenor. The next day, the party follow <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> to a secluded
part of the forest edge where they follow a river to the small village of
Nowhere.
</div>

### Session 7.5 - The Dancing Horse Mini-Chapter.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Crossed Swords arrived in Nowhere. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> excused herself saying that 
there was someone she needed to check in on and that the party should 
explore the village for a bit. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> went into the market and brought apples 
back for the horses. She tried learning how to juggle and taught Beauty and 
Blitz to approach her on command and taught Beauty how to ride in a circle 
with her standing on her back. Along with <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>, they devised a spectacular 
performance for the village.

<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> took Blitz into the market to have a look around. Suddenly everyone's
attention is drawn to the bridge where <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> ride up the market street.
<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> falls into the fountain in the village square whilst <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> rides beauty
around it. They dazzle the crowd earning 123 copper coins which <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> collects.
<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and Blitz start hyping up the crowd and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> perform another
routine to more rapturous applause, earning 86 more copper. Kids in the village
pet the horses and follow them back to the field.

<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> go into the tavern to spend their copper, drink mead and
play two truths, one lie. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>: I am blond (lie), I can play all
instruments (true - badly), I slept with Adran (true). <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> - I am a trained
hairdresser (true), I have some skill in mechanics (true), I partake in my
dad's dodgy business (lie). <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> - I do not have blue skin (lie), my family
are all tatoo artists (true), I have a brother who is kinda like a dog
(true). They notice that the town is mainly made up of humans though there
are 3 half-elves keeping to themselves at the back of the tavern. When they
ask the barman about this he reveals that there has been tensions between
the elves and people in the village. He says he can't stand elven kind and
preferred the music of the group's performance to the singing of
the elves the previous night. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> start to feel very
uncomfortable and take their mead to go.

Back at the cart, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> read. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> learns more about uncommon
undead, including Liths, and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> learns about the monsters of the plains.
<span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> starts drawing the party's adventures so far on the cart. She also
notices that a few scales on her armour have been moved. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> uses the
spell Detect Magic to try to see if there is someone there. The spell only
picks up the magical aura on <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>'s cloak of Elvenkind and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s necklace.
This is news to <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> sends <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> a magical scroll to say they are
chilling at the cart and will wait for her to return.
</div>

### Session 8

<div style="text-align: justify">
Whilst <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> cause chaos in Nowhere, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> reunites with Old Man
Lutz who is overjoyed to see her. He gives her food and asks about her travels
and her new friends. After a small catch up and a cup of tea, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> rejoins
the team who ask about the village and the animosity they felt from several
villagers. 

<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> responds that the village is a bit of a shithole. She then
brings Lutz down to join the party, and they all have dinner. Lutz tells them
about the village's past where elves from the Kingdom of Elgarest took over the
village during the war. Many people lost their lives and families were torn
apart. Once the war was over, the elves abandoned the village and went back
into the forest but did not leave any protections for the village. This has
caused tensions for the next generations who still hold on to this hate for the
elves. Old Man Lutz hopes one day to see peace restored between the elves and
the villagers.

After dinner, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> takes Old Man Lutz back home. He gives her
a poster which had been handed to him by some elves the week before. She puts
it into her pocket. He then tells her that someone is following her group. He
does not know the intentions of the being, only that they are being followed.
After he says this, he begins to shake, his eyes roll back and turn a bright
blue. He speaks in an ethereal voice: "Crown. Fire. Family. Death. Keep them
close." <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> rejoins the party, tells then what Old Man Lutz said in his
trance, and they set off for Kleopas.

The party continue to read their books. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> begins to teach the party some
fighter skills. During the journey, the party throw stones in an attempt to
reveal who is following them. They hit someone who shouts and throws a
stone back. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> give chase but the invisible creature
disappears. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> recognises the magic trace as Nom, the gnome that <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>
released from the Mythrandir prison.

When the party arrive in Klegas, there is bunting and food stalls
everywhere in preparation for The Festival of the Hunt. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> had been last
year's winner and had won a substantial amount of money. They go to <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s
mum, Maria's, hairdressers and are given food and tea. Maria is delighted to
see her daughter though surprised she is back in Klegas so soon. After
catching up for a bit Maria encourages the party to sign up for the
festival. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s dad Martin is out on business securing prizes but
will hopefully be back in time for dinner. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s brother Mark is apparently
doing business with a man named Baku in Mythrandir. She invites the entire
party to join the family for dinner that evening and encourages them to explore
the town. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> goes to the Tiefling District and explores a glassblowers shop,
aiding <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> in stealing a couple of items.

<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> go to the local magic shop. The owner reveals that <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s
necklace is an heirloom of the Elven Kingdom of Elgarest. The owner also
gives <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> some free items. When they ask about Nom and explain he is
following them, the magic owner rushes them out if the shop saying that Nom
is a powerful, fearsome being that he does not want to cross. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> then
goes to an old couple's house who nurture and sell animals. She meets a
black Raven who is keen to go on an adventure and spread his wings.
He settles on <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>'s shoulder. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> hears the sound of animalistic
laughing...
</div>

### Session 9

<div style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> informs <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> of the strange sound she heard but <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> doesn't recognise it.
The two meet up with <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> at The Armoury in the Dwarven Quater run by
Darin, an elderly skilled dwarf. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> buys chain mail and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> buys scale mail
in preparation for the Festival of the Hunt. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> is very nervous about the
competiton and asks if she might die. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> assures her that she won't die. They
head towards The Fighting Pit in the centre of the city and approach Krusk, a
middle aged half-orc with massive muscles and scarring. He has seen many fights
and is the organiser of The Hunt. He is overjoyed that <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> is going to take
part in this year's festival and signs them all up. They decide on the prize
they wish to win if they are victorious. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> opts for the weapon reward, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>
for the magical item reward and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> choose a boon reward. The party
return to <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s house for a delicious homecooked meal and dessert and meet
Martin, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s dad who is delighted that his daughter is home and entering the
festival. After dinner, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> teaches the party some fighting skills and they
rest up ready for the competition. At 10am the next morning, the fighters are
in position. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> is in the halfling quater with a strange half-elf, later
revealed to be Beiro, one of <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>'s brothers. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> is in the gnome quarter
with the hyena-like being she had heard earlier and a half-orc. These are
Grunt (a knoll) and Feng, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>'s other two brothers. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> is in the human quarter
with an older, slightly rugged dwarf who is later revealed to be Vondal, an
uncle-like figure to <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> is in the tiefling quarter with a number of local
Klegas combatants. Krusk stands atop The Fighting Pit in the VIP box with
Martin Strongbrooke to his left and a fierce half-orc to his right. This is
Thokk, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>'s father. The battles begin. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>, <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> easily take out a
couple of monsters in their areas. Feng and Grunt take out quite a few as well.
<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> struggles with her fight against the first monster but eventually kills
it. This awakens a tree which attacks her and Beiro. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> use their
rogue sneak attacks to do severe damage against the monsters and rack up
points. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> uses her action surge to land an extra blow on her final area
monster raising her point total. Martin and Thokk cheer loudly for their
daughters from their viewpoint. With the help of Beiro, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> manages to land
the final blow killing the tree and boosting her points. All the combatants
make their way to The Fighting Pit where they face off against a manticore.
This mythical beast is tough. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> jumps on its back, stabbing it. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> run up and land several damaging blows. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> is flung off the beast.
<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> inspires herself and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> from the side of the arena. The members of The
Rat Pack all take turns attacking the beast and do some damage. The manicore
hits back ferociously. After several big hits from <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>, the
manticore attempts to flee and takes to the skies. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> attempts to bring it
down but the arrow just misses. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> pulls out her shortbow and, using her
inspiration, fires an arrow which takes down the beast. This kill gives her an
additional 15 points and secures her the win. She receives the magical item
reward: a pair of winged boots.
</div>

#### DM's comments

<div style="text-align: justify">
The fight was very close. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> brought the manticore's health down to quite low.
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> would have won if she had landed both blows. Her second blow took 
its HP down to 5 which was why it tried to fly away.
<span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> would have won if she had hit it with her long bow.
If <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> hadn't used her inspiration dice, she would have missed and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> 
would have had a shot at the win.
Genuinely, it was so bloody close, it was insane. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s attack was a 12 
to hit but the armour class was 14 and the inspiration die rolled a 2. So 
you just managed to hit it and got the win.
It was a crazy competition and anyone's game at the end. I genuinely had no 
idea who was going to win.
Well played!
</div>

### Session 10

<div style="text-align: justify">
<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> is crowned the winner of the Festival of the Hunt and is awarded the
winged boots. Krusk invites all the participants to a large feast in the
Fighting Pit that evening and encourages then to enjoy the rest of the festival
in the town. Thokk and Martin both fuss over their daughters, saying how proud
they are of them and their efforts in the festival. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> then challenges Thokk
to a one-on-one fight to showcase her skills. He defeats her fairly easily (she
had of course, just been battling several creatures!). The whole party join The
Rat Pack and Martin for drinks in the Half-Orc Quarter's local pub where <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>
and Feng get absolutely wasted. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> starts to tell Feng about their
adventures in Stormwreck Isle and the undead they fought. On hearing this,
Thokk and Martin begin whispering which <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> picks up on. On the way back to The
Fighting Pit, Martin pulls <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> aside and asks her to tell him more about
Stormwreck Isle. He reveals that The Rat Pack and several other fighters are
leading an assault on The Metal Mines in the morning as hoards of undead have
been spotted coming out of the mines. The mine boss has also been missing for a
couple of weeks. Many are afraid that Klegas will soon be under attack. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>
eavesdrops on Thokk and Vondal discussing the morning assault and how Vespera
Shadowmire may be involved after hearing <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>'s drunken ramblings. On
arriving at The Fighting Pit, the party hear the familiar notes of the
Fleetwood Trio. They talk to Maria who reveals that Vespera Shadowmire is one
of her clients. She is part of a noble family with connections to the Elven
King of Elgarest but reveals that she was poorly treated and abused by her
father growing up. This was part of the reason why she had joined the council,
in order to help those trapped in abusive circumstances. Maria also notes that
Vespera has seemed distant and strange in recent appointments. The feast begins
and Thokk presents <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> as Champion of the Hunt. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> gives a quick speech to
raucous applause. The party then retire for the evening and discuss what they
are going to do. In the morning, the party walks through a quiet Klegas and out
the southern gates. There are guards and fighters preparing themselves for
battle. Adran calls out to <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and reveals that the Fleetwood Trio are going
to help the city guard protect Klegas from an assault on its walls. After a
slightly awkward conversation, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> parts feeling inspired. The party overtake
the fighters and, following <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>'s directions, arrive at The Metal Mines where
they see a hoard of zombies and skeletons in the basin area in front of the
mines. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> uses her winged boots to get a better view. They hear a loud
scraping sound and a skeleton minotaur appears above the entrance to the mine
and roars loudly. A ghast exits the mine entrance, sees <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and says "
Welcome" then bids the hoard of undead to advance and they begin moving 
towards
our party and towards Klegas.
</div>

### Session 11

<div style="text-align: justify">
The hoard continues to move towards Klegas and the ghast goes back into the 
mines. The party spring into action. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> use their rogue skills 
to sneak towards the mines whilst the fighters from Klegas begin their 
attack on the hoard. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> keeps to the skies and manages to land, 
undetected, at the mine entrance. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> begins her assault on the skeletons 
and zombies, firing arrows from a vantage point. The skeleton minotaur 
notices <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> approaching and encourages them to attack him. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>
<span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> begin their assault on the minotaur. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> notices a strange 
pattern of dust in the distance from where they came. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> is pinned back by 
skeletons and can't move from her position. The skeleton minotaur brings 
its great axe down onto <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>, almost killing her. She manages to move away 
and heal herself. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> gives her a potion. 
At this point, the sound of an engine is heard and an armoured vehicle 
smashes through the hoard. Martin Strongbrooke behind the wheel shouts out 
"Now!" and The Rat Pack burst out and begin attacking the hoard. 

Thokk rushes to help <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span>. Martin asks where <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> is and immediately swings 
the car round to pick her up. The attack on the minotaur continues. Martin 
brings <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> through the hoard to the front of the mines. Together, the party 
defeats the minotaur with <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> landing the final blow causing bones dust to 
fly everywhere. The Rat Pack and Martin stay outside to fight off the hoard 
whilst the party enter the mines. They defeat the remaining zombies and 
skeletons inside and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> finds a chest filled with jewels. 

<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> finds a skeleton horse still attached to its mining cart and mercy 
 kills it. The party come across a well which <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> investigate. 
When they move a cart blocking the exit, walls close up at the exits and 
the room suddenly starts filling with water. They move the cart back to its 
original position and climb over it instead. On the 2nd floor, they find a 
laboratory where <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> finds a diamond. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> searches the barracks. "Is that 
a chest?" No, it was a wall. 

<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> sneaks around the corner and notices the ghast blocking the door with 
two ghouls. The party decide to go for a sneak attack and manage to take 
them out surprisingly easily. They use the lift to head down into the 3rd 
and final floor. On the final floor, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> finds a chest with jewels and 
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> looks around the corner leading to the mine boss's office. She sees 
a figure, somewhere between life and death, furiously scribbling on paper 
and muttering to himself.
</div>

### Session 12

<div style="text-align: justify">
The party draw out the wight whilst <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> sneaks behind him. They attack him 
and are able to defeat him quite quickly. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> gathers his notes on the 
various jewels in the mine, their location and what they are worth. The 
wight had some gold on his person and a locket with photo of a man, a woman 
and a young girl inside it. 

The party head down the carved out corridor with stone pillars. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> 
reads the writing on the wall, and it appears to be a temple dedicated to 
the God of Necromancy, Velsharoon. They approach a chamber with a door on 
one side and 4 dragon statues in each corner. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> identifies the door as 
being trapped. The party retreat to the corridor and <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> throws a rock at 
the door handle which triggers the trap. Spears shoot out into the empty 
space and the door opens. 

The party descend into the darkness and come across a large underground 
chamber with four carved pillars in each corner. The pillars are glowing 
blue and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> reads the carvings which discuss the resurrection of 
Velsharoon. At the end of the chamber they see stairs leading to an altar. 
Inara is chained on one side of the alter. Vespera stands holding her hands 
aloft. The silver dragon egg is in front of her, and she is wearing <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>'s 
necklace which is glowing red. 

Vespera's skin is grey and her eyes are fairly lifeless. She is slowly 
becoming a lich. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> begin sneaking forward and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> sends a 
message to Inara that they are here to help. Vespera continues the ritual 
until <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> shoots her necklace away, and it lands on the other side of the 
altar. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> flies up and takes it. Vespera follows immediately and a battle 
ensues. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> releases Inara who helps the party. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> secures the dragon 
egg. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> rushes up to Verspera and she and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> engage in close combat.

Vespera uses her lich abilities and her lair's magic to inflict heavy damage 
on the party, bringing three of them into the red zone. <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> attempts to 
flee with the necklace and fires an arrow straight through Vespera's head. 
Seconds before being shot, her skin returns to its normal hue, her eyes 
widen, and she says "<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>, I'm sorry". <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> uses her talk to the dead 
spell to ask Vespera some questions. The party panics and asks questions 
that don't really give any insight other than Vespera is connected to 
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> in some way. 

The party leave the mines and Inara uses her magic to collapse the tunnel 
behind them, leaving Vespera's body and the temple of Velsharoon in ruins. 
The party make their way to the mine entrance and hear the voices of The 
Rat Pack and Martin Strongbrooke.

### Session 13
<div style="text-align: justify">
The party reunite with Martin Strongbrooke and The Rat Pack at the mine
entrance. Inara checks the dragon egg and the necklace to ensure Vespera's 
spell is not lingering on them. They are clear, but she does note that 
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span>'s necklace has a curse on it. The party return to Klegas where Adran 
asks if <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> wants to go for a drink. She agrees. Maria pulls <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> aside 
and shows her <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s wanted poster. She informs <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> that high elves have 
been seen in Klegas and that she can help get them out. 

Wanting to leave quickly, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> reluctantly sends Rook to retrieve <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>. 
He poops on Adran who has to clean himself off and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> leaves a note for 
him saying "Raincheck". When reunited with the party, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> uses her magic 
to alter self. <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and The Rat Pack have an emotional goodbye, and they vow 
to distract as many high elves as possible in the city. Martin and Maria 
meet the party at the farm, give them supplies and see them off. The 
Strongbrookes ask <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> to look for her brother Mark when back in Mythrandir 
as he was doing business with Baku, and they haven't heard from him in 2 weeks. 

En route to Nowhere, the party encounter a merchant who says he has tricked 
some villagers in Aerith by giving them false supplies, and now they are 
chasing him. He offers the party some of his takings if they redirect the 
mob. The party agrees and take his supplies. When the mob arrives, they 
send them towards Klegas. 

In Nowhere, <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> speaks to Old Man Lutz who tells her that he became 
aware of the curse on her necklace when <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> became ill when wearing the 
necklace after mother died. He put a protection on her so that the curse 
did not affect her. He also informs her that her father is alive and is the 
Kingsguard Paladin, Calmacil Shadowmire. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> reintroduces him to <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> 
and her necklace which is similar to her own. Old Man Lutz tells them the 
necklace is one of the Elven Crown Jewels but says he will not tell <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> 
any more of her story as it is not his story to tell. He also informs <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> 
that her father is in Aerith as he was on his way to meet <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> in Klegas 
after she won the Festival of the Hunt. 

The party head to Aerith where they arrive at <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s old home. Smoke is 
rising from the chimney, and they find <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s father Taris Sylfir inside. 
They gather round the table and <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> shows her dad the wanted poster and 
asks for the truth. Taris reveals a wanted poster of himself and tells 
<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> that his true name is not Taris Sylfir but Taris Perorra, bastard son 
of the late, late King of Elgarest. Her mother is the Elven Queen Orilana 
Sylfir from the Elven Mountain Kingdom of Ered. Her mother was forced to 
marry his brother Eladithas Perorra in order to unite the two kingdoms and 
stop the war. 

At that time, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> and her father were banished. Now Taris's brother is 
dead and the new King Sylmenor Perorra (<span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span>'s half brother) is looking 
for them. He also reveals that the necklace opens a portal to the Feywild 
and that only the true heir to the Elven throne can use the phrase to open 
the portal. At this point, <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> is pulled off her seat by an invisible 
force which takes the necklace and runs out of the house. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span>, <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> and 
<span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> leap into action and try to grab the necklace. <span style="color:#BAE8FF">Lia</span> and <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> block 
the path whilst <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> grapples with the invisible man. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> shouts "Nom" 
and he appears. He begs them to open the portal with the necklace. <span style="color:#141524">Renfri</span> 
and <span style="color:#6C5078">Pip</span> calm him down, and he agrees to wait until morning once they've had 
a chance to keep talking. 

Back inside the house, Taris tells <span style="color:#46503C">Jessy</span> the phrase which she utters. 
Suddenly, the party find themselves transported into the Feywild. Standing 
before them where Nom had been is a tall, muscular figure with skin the 
colour of oak. His hair is thatched and braided with brambles, and he wears 
a cloak of green leaves stitched onto brown leather. He thanks the party 
and introduces himself as Oberon, the Faerie King, Lord of Beasts and deity 
of the wilderness and animals.
