## <u>**Summaries**</u>

### Session 1

<div style="text-align: justify">
In the city of Mythrandir, on the continent of Terra, a
team are being assembled by Akra, a teifling fighter and leader of the Slayer's
Take (a group that procures rare things for profit). 
Jessi, posing as a human bard, is looking for adventure and inspiration 
in her songwriting.

Together with Lia, a human fighter, Pip, a teifing rogue, and Renfri a 
half-elf rogue, they are tasked by Akra to retrieve basilisk fangs from 
Storm Wreck Isle and collect information from a sorceress called Inara.  
After embarking on a boat with Joshua, the party is attacked by
Sahuagine. Lia manages to kill them, while Jessi sings encouragement at the 
back.

The party arrives at Storm Wreck Isle and travel to the 
town of Dragons Rest. 2 groups of zombies were awaiting them in the woods. 
Lia and Jessi engage the zombies, whilst Renfri and Pip wander 
into the trees. The fight was short, Jessi managing to enchant one zombie to 
flail around in the other direction drawing the others' attention. 
However, as Jessi was concentrating on the spell, her disguise slipped, 
revealing her half-elven lineage, where Lia was able to perceive but kept 
to herself.

The party eventually make it to town, and are on edge. There they discover a 
temple that worships the dragon, Runara, and meet Inara within. Inara 
gives the party information as to the basilisks' whereabouts, and
also tasks them to find out the cause of the island's zombie infestation.

Afterward, the party head to a pub to settle in for the night for much 
needed rest. Jessi performs, and the party gets to know each other a
little.
</div>

#### Song
<div style="text-align: justify">
    
    In the land of Mythrandir, a grand adventure begins, a mission from the Slayers
    Take, one they're determined to win.
    Lia the warrior, fierce as fire within.
    Pip, the tricky tiefling rogue, quick and sly.
    Renfri, the half-elf rogue, secrets in her eye.
    
    Joined by Jessi, the bard with a melody so sweet,
    Together they set sail to a land so neat.
    Across the sea to Storm Wreck Isle they steer,
    Their hearts filled with hope, dispelling all fear.
    
    Oh, they're the Cross Swords, a band so brave,
    Facing danger head-on, their spirits never wane.
    Unyielding in their quest, they'll battle all foes,
    And in the end, they'll be hailed as heroes.
    
    Upon their voyage, the sea churns and roars,
    As they battle the Sahuaugine, those sea-dwelling horrors.
    With swords and spells, they fight side by side,
    United in purpose, their courage can't hide.
    
    Arriving at Dragons Rest, an ancient land of lore,
    Skeletons and zombies rise, an undead galore.
    But the Cross Swords stand strong, their will unshakeable,
    With their blades gleaming bright, they remain unstoppable.
    
    With hearts ablaze, they descend into the depths,
    Facing basilisks, the guardians they must best.
    Through perilous darkness, they navigate,
    Their unity and strength the darkness can't abate.
    
    Oh, they're the Cross Swords, a band so brave,
    Facing danger head-on, their spirits never wane.
    Unyielding in their quest, they'll battle all foes,
    And in the end, they'll be hailed as heroes.
    
    Emerging triumphant from the deepest abyss,
    The Cross Swords are hailed, the tale of their prowess.
    Heroes of Dragon Rest, their fame spreads wide,
    The saviors of darkness, with hearts unified.
    
    With heads held high, their victory they claim,
    Forever remembered, immortalized in name.
    Lia, Pip, Renfri, and Jessi, a fellowship true,
    The Cross Swords, a symbol of courage anew.
    
    Oh, they're the Cross Swords, a band so brave,
    Facing danger head-on, their spirits never wane.
    Unyielding in their quest, they'll battle all foes,
    And in the end, they'll be hailed as heroes.
    
    Dragons Rest sings of their valor and might,
    The Cross Swords forever shining in the light.
    Their journey may end, but their legacy remains,
    A testament to friendship, overcoming all pains.
</div>

### Session 2
<div style="text-align: justify">
The party set off from The Dragon's Rest towards the observatory to investigate
the source of the undead and to find the missing sorcerer, Jensen. Whilst
moving through the woods, Lia hears the sound of Zombies approaching. 
Three Zombies attack the party who choose to stay and fight, managing 
to defeat them. A hoard then arrives on the horizon but the party is 
saved by Runara, the Bronze Dragon who resides on Stormwreck Isle. 
Runara thanks the party for attempting to restore the natural order and 
protects them on their way to the observatory.

Once there, the party are set upon by several skeletons. Pip and Renfri take
these out by using their rogue stealth and acrobatics. The party then make
their way up the observatory tower and come across Jensen's quarters where they
find a broken mirror with Elvish inscriptions that Renfri is able to decipher.

On the top floor of the observatory, the party encounter three skeletons, a now
dead and shackled Zombie Jensen, and a mysterious hooded figure in black robes
chanting a spell in Elvish, Infernal and (what Inara later identifies as) Deep
Speech. The figure hears the party and vanishes, leaving behind a pulsating,
glowing purple orb. 

The party make quick work of the skeletons and Pip and Lia
investigate the orb. Jessy, having missed all her previous attacks against the
skeletons, fires the killing blow to take out Jensen. Both Lia and Jessy work
together to destroy the orb and the spell over the Isle is broken. The party
retires to Jensen's old quarters in the observatory tower and Renfri discovers
his diary in a hidden drawer.
</div>

#### Song
<div>
    
    (Verse 1)
    In a land full of darkness, where shadows do roam,
    There's a hero, they say, but I don't feel at home.
    I've fought many battles, with creatures of the night,
    But when it comes to skeletons, I just can't get it right.
    
    (Pre-Chorus)
    My sword swings wide, but it always goes astray,
    Those bony foes, they taunt me with decay.
    But when the horde of zombies come crawling through,
    I rise up with courage, knowing just what to do.
    
    (Chorus)
    I'm rubbish at killing skeletons, that's for sure,
    But I'm a master when it comes to zombies, I endure.
    With every swing and every strike, I'll face the undead,
    And I'll emerge victorious, that's where my strength is spread.
    
    (Verse 2)
    Those skeleton warriors, they dance with such grace,
    Dodging my attacks, always one step ahead of my pace.
    Their bones rattle and clatter, mocking my skill,
    But I'll keep on fighting, determined to fulfill.
    
    (Pre-Chorus)
    My aim may be off, my arrows miss their marks,
    But when the zombie horde surrounds me in the dark,
    I'll unleash my might, with an unyielding zeal,
    Their bodies will crumble, my prowess will reveal.
    
    (Chorus)
    I'm rubbish at killing skeletons, that's for sure,
    But I'm a master when it comes to zombies, I endure.
    With every swing and every strike, I'll face the undead,
    And I'll emerge victorious, that's where my strength is spread.
    
    (Bridge)
    The skeletons may sneer and laugh in their decay,
    But I'll prove them wrong, I'll find a better way.
    I'll train and grow stronger, honing my attack,
    Until the day I conquer, and their bones shall crack.
    
    (Chorus)
    I'm rubbish at killing skeletons, that's for sure,
    But I'm a master when it comes to zombies, I endure.
    With every swing and every strike, I'll face the undead,
    And I'll emerge victorious, that's where my strength is spread.
</div>

### Session 3
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The party stay the night in Jensen's quarters in the observatory. During that
    time they eat food and read the pages of Jensen's diary which reveals a member
    of the council of Mythrandir has been visiting the island. In the morning, they
    ask Inara about the potions which she identifies to be the Good Hope, Haste and
    Sanctuary potions. When asked about the council member, she says she has an
    idea but doesn't reveal anything until Renfri presses her for more information
    later on. She then reveals to Renfri that she is suspicious of Vespera
    Shadowmire, her old mentor, who she knows has been leaving on various research
    missions. She vows to confront her on her return to Mythrandir. The party then
    enter the caves under the observatory and battle two basilisks, working
    together using the shards of Jensen's mirror to defeat the basilisks with ease.
    Pip and Renfri deal the final blows. On exiting the caves, Jessy's true
    identity is revealed: she is in fact a half-elf, not a human and is 92 years
    old. Whilst Pip and Lia are forgiving of Jessy, Renfri keeps her distance. The
    party returns to the celebrating town of Dragon's Rest and are given free
    drinks by the bartender Greg who asks them what they call themselves. At the
    moment: The Cross Swords.
</div>

### Session 4
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The party is awoken by the sound of bells and witnesses the town of Dragon's
    Rest reburying their dead and mourning the loss of Jensen. The party then waits
    for Inara in the library and return as a group to Mythrandir where they receive
    their bounty. Inara gives them a map of the city and says she will be back in
    touch. The party explore the city. They first enter The Crimson Sash clothing
    store and meet an elderly gnome called Lilli Nim who repairs their tattered
    clothes and designs their outfits with the Cross Swords symbol. The party then
    split up to explore further. Renfri, with the goal to steal from the rich,
    tries to enter the Inner Sanctum through the main gate but it is guarded.
    Instead she enters the Temple of Bahamut but decides that this is not the place
    to steal and joins Lia in the Magic Shop, Jinx and Trinkets. Lia, with the goal
    to improve her magic abilities, meets Kribi Mirlon, the Magic Shop owner, who
    creates a perception potion for her. Both go to join Pip and Jessy at the
    weapons shop: Tintagel Weapon Shop. Pip and Jessy meet Merlin and his
    apprentice Arthur and receive new weapons and upgrades to their armour. Renfri
    also receives an upgrade when she arrives. The party then go to The Green
    Dragon pub where Jessy performs for the crowd. Pip notices the symbol of The
    Swallow Thieves Guild and enters the secret underground lair where she
    encounters an old friend of her father: the leader of The Swallows, a half-orc
    named Baku. Armed with new illicit trinkets, she returns to the group and a
    very suspicious Renfri. The party rest for the night and return to The Slayer's
    Take where there is a notice from the local farmer asking for help to kill an
    Ankheg in exchange for 10 Gold and a horse and cart. Akra approaches Jessy and
    reveals that a high level political client has offered a large amount of money
    for the theft of the silver dragon egg in the study of Soros Davino, the leader
    of the Myrandir Council.
</div>

### Session 5
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The party organised their outfits with Lilli Nim and returned to The Slayer's
    Take where Akra asked them for a rundown of their plan to enter the mansion.
    Inara called via the earring and said she was going to confront Vespera
    Shadowmire at the party and that she had a +1 ticket. Renfri took the ticket
    and organised to attend with Inara. Pip and Lia decided to take the 2 tickets
    provided by Akra's client and pretend to be nobles from Klegas. Jessy met with
    her rival, Adran Amastacia, the lead singer of The Fleetwood Trio, and
    bargained her way into joining the band who had been booked as entertainment.
    On arriving at the mansion, Pip and Lia bumped into Kribi who revealed he was a
    member of the council and the three of them had many drinks. Renfri was
    introduced to Soros Davino (the leader of the council) and Lyslyl Strongsong (a
    paladin from the Temple of Bahamut and member of the council). Everyone was
    gathered in the dining room where Soros gave a speech about the nations coming
    together in peace. During the meal, the party met Vespera Shadowmire who was
    wearing a necklace that Renfri recognised immediately. She remarked to Jessy "
    Is that the name you are going by nowadays?" She then told Pip and Lia that she
    has some upcoming business near Klegas but was unsure if she would make The
    Festival of the Hunt. After dinner she excused herself and left quickly,
    followed swiftly by Inara. Whilst the party scouted the mansion, Renfri hears
    the word "Ren-" before silence. She rushed to the main door and asked the
    guards what had happened. They were unresponsive and clearly under a spell.
    Renfri called for Jessy who was able to break the spell and the guards revealed
    that Vespera and Inara had argued before Vespera had grabbed Inara saying "I
    need another sorcerer now anyway" and both had disappeared. Whilst Jessy went
    to break the news of Inara's kidnap to the council, Pip managed to scale the
    building and land on the upper balconies revealing two small bedrooms and a
    master bedroom. The doors were sealed with magic and she couldn't get in. Lia
    overheard Soros saying that the room was secure as the guards had the keys and
    swiped a set of keys from an unsuspecting guard which she handed to Renfri. On
    the second floor, Lia and Renfri managed to trick a guard into following them
    into Inara's guest room where they locked him in. Lia then distracted the final
    guard by trying to flirt with him whilst Renfri snuck up onto the top floor.
    There she encountered a sleeping Hellhound and struggled to put the keys in the
    lock. This woke the hellhound. Renfri managed to get through the door and over
    to the balcony to open the window for Pip as the Hellhound attacked. She sent a
    signal to the team for help. Hearing this Jessy joined Lia on the second floor
    and charmed the final guard who let them past. Pip was able to talk to the
    Hellhound using Infernal and was able to encourage it out onto the balcony. Lia
    picked up a lamp from outside the room and the party was able to use this to
    solve the mirror riddle. Once inside the study they came across a Gargoyle who
    asked a riddle. Lia was able to remember the speech Soros had given at dinner
    and gave the answer: Footsteps. The Gargoyle released the Silver Dragon Egg and
    Pip and Lia managed to carry it outside. Renfri and Pip made graceful landings
    when jumping off the balcony, Lia did not. The egg made it safely. Jessy
    returned to the band. Pip retrieved Inara's carriage and took Lia and Renfri
    back to The Slayer's Take where Akra stored the egg in a secret room under the
    floorboards. The Fleetwood Trio then burst into The Slayer's Take to reveal
    that Jessy's charm had worn off the guard and that she had been arrested.
</div>

### Session 6
<div style="text-align: justify">
    On finding out Jessy had been arrested, Akra told the party to get rid of
    Inara's carriage and find somewhere to hide till the exchange for the dragon
    egg had been made. Pip got rid of the carriage outside the city and was able to
    sneak back in to meet Renfri and Lia at the local tavern. Pip took the pair
    into the Swallow's Den where they met Pip's uncle Baku who let them rest the
    night and sent his Swallows out to find out where Jessy was being kept. He also
    gave Pip a cloak of Elvenkind as a gift. Baku recognised Lia's last name,
    Strongbrooke, and revealed that he knows her father well and is currently doing
    business with her brother. The party make a plan and one of Baku's Swallows, a
    gnome named Baldur, dimension doored them into a cupboard in the council.
    During this time, Jessy was making music in her cell with a halfling named
    Bolger who was in for not paying his taxes. She sent a message to the party
    saying that she had been arrested and gave a rough location of the cell she was
    in. Lia attempted to draw the guards away from the servant quarter doors by
    causing a distraction but it didn't work. Pip put on a janitor's outfit and
    convinced the guard that she was finishing up the back shift. The guard
    followed Pip into the servant quarters whilst Lia stayed hidden in the main
    hall and Renfri kept watch from the cupboard. Inside the servant quarters, Pip
    watched two guards exit the staircase guarded by a gargoyle and saw two other
    guards replace them using the password "sandstone". Pip then knocked out the
    guard watching her and used the password to sneak downstairs. At this point Lia
    snuck into the room and was able to send a message to Pip to get the password.
    Lia and Pip made their way through the underground jail and passed a cell which
    had a gnome inside called Nom who asked to be released. Pip agreed to release
    him if he would help save Jessy. Nom agreed. Jessy's cell was guarded by the
    two guards from the changeover and a hellhound. Pip pushed Nom forward who
    struck the hellhound with blue lighting magic and it chased him back towards
    the exit. Pip and Lia attacked the guards with the aid of Jessy who managed to
    steal keys off the distracted guards. Once free, Jessy offered freedom to
    Bolger who refused. Reunited, Jessy, Lia and Pip made their way back to the
    exit and came across Nom who was laughing hysterically and ripping apart the
    hellhound with his hands. They all retreated back up to the servant's quarters.
    Meanwhile, from her vantage point Renfri watched as Soros entered the council
    main hall with an older woman dressed in green robes laced with bronze. She had
    a tiara-like headpiece embedded with emeralds and made of bronze with two
    pieces that went up like horns. She turned to the cupboard asked Renfri to come
    out. Renfri informs Baku through the dimension door that they may be
    compromised and he closes the portal. Renfri exits and discovers the woman is
    Runara, the bronze dragon from Stormwreck Isle, in human form. Nom peaks out
    the door of the servant quarters, sees Soros and Runara and disappears
    immediately. Runara calls the party out and they all reunite. She brings news
    that a hoard of undead have been seen around the Metal Mines, south from the
    city of Klegas. She enlists the party's aid and Soros agrees to this saying
    that if they solve this they will be absolved of their crimes. He also asks for
    the return of the silver dragon egg. The party, now free and with a mission for
    the council and Runara, return to The Slayer's Take where Akra gives them their
    earnings from the dragon egg heist and a map of the continent. The party
    undertake a mission from The Hunt Board in The Slayer's Take and help farmer
    Bran Brightwood kill an Ankheg that has been terrorising his sheep. In exchange
    for their help he gives them 10 gold and the use of a horse and cart. The party
    choose Beauty, a black gypsy cob with a speck of white on her forehead who
    seems calm and friendly. As part of the deal they have to take her son, a pony
    yet to be named. The party look forward to pimping their cart as their journey
    continues.
</div>

### Session 7
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The party prepares to set out for Klegas. All four head to Jinx & Trinkets
    Magic Shop where they encounter Kribi who is aware of the mission set by Runara
    and Soros. He gives Lia an everburning torch and Renfri a fireball scroll. He
    agrees to look out for any protective armour and if he finds some he will
    deliver it on to Klegas. Renfri and Jessy then head to the Raven's Tower
    Library where they encounter Corrin, an elderly halfing and friend of Inara.
    Hearing that they are en route to rescue Inara, he gives them a book of
    necromancy and the undead. Jessy buys a book on monsters of the plains and
    Renfri borrows a book about the Elven families in the Kingdom of Elgarest.
    Renfri also borrows a book on Deep Speech in an attempt to learn it and
    decipher the spellbook which Corrin reveals to be Vespera Shadowmire's
    spellbook. Lia and Pip head to Tintagel Weapon Shop and ask Merlin for some
    upgrades. He reinforces Lia's scimitar, gives Pip 30 lighting darts and banes
    Pip's dagger against the undead. Renfri and Jessy arrive and have their daggers
    baned against the undead too. Before leaving, Renfri finds Baku and sells him 5
    tomes that she stole from Corrin's library. The party leave Mythrandir and set
    off on the long journey to Klegas. During the journey, Renfri reads the Deep
    Speech book and gains some insight into the language. Pip and Jessy read the
    book of the undead and become very familiar with the creatures in it. They also
    read a couple of pages on the monsters of the plains. The first night passes
    with no issue. On the second night, the party discover that their things have
    been rummaged through. Nothing has been taken, but items have been moved. On
    the third day, the party are attacked by a group of goblins on wargs. The party
    put up a good fight with Lia and Renfri managing to take some out, scaring off
    the remaining rider and warg. Pip gets knocked unconscious but is revived by
    Jessy. Pip then speaks to the remaining warg and encourages it to flee. The
    party continue on and encounter no more monsters. On the fifth night, they hear
    elves singing in the woods. They are mourning the 20 year anniversary of the
    death of King Eladithas who has been succeeded by his son King Sylmenor. The
    next day, the party follow Renfri to a secluded part of the forest edge where
    they follow a river to the small village of Nowhere.
</div>

### Session 7.5 - The Dancing Horse Mini-Chapter.
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The party arrived in Nowhere. Renfri excused herself saying that there was
    someone she needed to check in on and that the party should explore the village
    for a bit. Pip went into the market and brought apples back for the horses. She
    tried learning how to juggle and taught Beauty and Blitz to approach her on
    command and taught Beauty how to ride in a circle with her standing on her
    back. Along with Jessy, they devised a spectacular performance for the village.
    Lia took Blitz into the market to have a look around. Suddenly everyone's
    attention is drawn to the bridge where Pip and Jessy ride up the market street.
    Jessy falls into the fountain in the village square whilst Pip rides beauty
    around it. They dazzle the crowd earning 123 copper coins which Lia collects.
    Lia and Blitz start hyping up the crowd and Pip and Jessy perform another
    routine to more rapturous applause, earning 86 more copper. Kids in the village
    pet the horses and follow them back to the field. Lia, Pip and Jessy go into
    the tavern to spend their copper, drink mead and play two truths, one lie.
    Jessy: I am blond (lie), I can play all instruments (true - badly), I slept
    with Adran (true). Lia - I am a trained hairdresser (true), I have some skill
    in mechanics (true), I partake in my dad's dodgy business (lie). Pip - I do not
    have blue skin (lie), my family are all tatoo artists (true), I have a brother
    who is kinda like a dog (true). They notice that the town is mainly made up of
    humans though there are 3 half-elves keeping to themselves at the back of the
    tavern. When they ask the barman about this he reveals that there has been
    tensions between the elves and people in the village. He says he can't stand
    elven kind and preferred the music of the group's performance to the singing of
    the elves the previous night. Pip, Lia and Jessy start to feel very
    uncomfortable and take their mead to go. Back at the cart, Jessy and Lia read.
    Jessy learns more about uncommon undead, including Liths, and Lia learns about
    the monsters of the plains. Pip starts drawing the party's adventures so far on
    the cart. She also notices that a few scales on her armour have been moved.
    Jessy uses the spell Detect Magic to try to see if there is someone there. The
    spell only picks up the magical aura on Pip's cloak of Elvenkind and Jessy's
    necklace. This is news to Jessy. Jessy sends Renfri a magical scroll to say
    they are chilling at the cart and will wait for her to return.
