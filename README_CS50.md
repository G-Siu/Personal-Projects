    Description: The project outlined in CS50p is left up to me to work
    through, with the minimum requirements of at least 3 functions in the code.
    Along my current interest in Critical Role, I chose to focus on a D&D dice
    roller that takes into account of a character's modifiers. The character can be
    created or can be retrieved from previously created using this script.
